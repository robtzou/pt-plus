    "merged_reviews": "Aric is a really good professor who really gets you to learn the material the right way.  I have struggled with understanding object oriented programming for a long time, but under his teaching I was finally able to master it. Excellent Professor! Learned a ton and highly recommend! Great professor Honestly an amazing professor that wants you to understand the topics the class goes over very well. The documentation for all projects is very detailed and clear, plus the explanations for all the concept is really easy to understand. Aric is also a really nice person and very understanding. He's willing to take time to talk with you one on one so that you can go over what you don't understand with him and try to clear up any difficulties. 100% recommend taking him if he has a class in the semester. He's so nice and his lectures are incredibly well-organized and easy to understand. The pace of the class is great and I really feel like I've learned a lot compared to other coding classes I have taken. Pros: Prof. is very down to earth, easy going, understanding, great feedback, class has both in person and online lectures. Some struggled in this class, but I have previous programming experience so it was much easier for me. I learned a lot and nearly earned a 100%. \r\n\r\nCons: Nothing honestly, I really enjoyed this class and he's one of my favorite Profs. at UMD. Aric is one of my favorite professors at UMD. He is extremely fair to students and very accessible outside of class. His assignments can be hard and time-consuming but the instructional team is always available to give you guidance. I learned so much about python in his class and I feel that he genuinely cares about and wants to connect with his students. Aric is the absolute man. He is so understanding and willing to compromise if you need an extension. This is also the class in which I've learned the most in my entire experience. I came in as a very below average coder but Aric got me up to speed and now I'm so much more comfortable with Python. The workload is definitely not easy but he's a fantastic teacher. Also a great lecturer. My favorite professor thus far for sure. I wouldn't rate Aric a full 5 stars. Lectures don't really cover concepts, you watch videos on your own time, and come to class to complete practice assignments based on the concepts the videos covered. Another thing is the homework assignments, the homework assignments are honestly rather difficult. You'll likely pass, but be prepared to struggle. Tough grader as well, here's what to expect in the class:\r\n\r\n4 major coding homeworks (1 ended up being dropped due to aric getting sick and the schedule got funky)\r\n4 exams\r\n1 group project\r\nWeekly practice and exercises\r\n\r\nExams are actually not bad, practice exams are provided and the actual exams are VERY similar to practice ones. The group project also isn't too bad, you come up with an idea for a program and execute it. The worst part are the homeworks, but if you are comfortable or rather comfortable with basic python concepts, you'll pass! it might be intimidating the first couple weeks and you may begin to doubt your ability, but stick to it, I really was considering dropping the class because I was doubting myself, but I'm glad I didn't because I really do feel I came out as a better programmer. Aric\u2019s definitely one of the best professors on campus. Coming with mediocre python skills, his class challenges your growth and understanding starting from the basics to more convoluted subjects. He\u2019s generous with extensions and office hours. All his UTA\u2019s are very helpful and available. Don\u2019t slack on practices, late penalty is 50%. Amazing teacher and will definitely help you learn Python better. I personally learned nothing from INST126 and Aric made it so I learned Python. He has a lot of TA's who are extremly helpful so office hours aren't loaded. There is a bit of work so start things early. He has 4 exams but they are only 25% of your grade. Overall would definitely recommend. Definitely not an easy course compared to INST126, but aric gives you the resources and the materials to succeed. Hes a compassionate guy that cares about his students, and is a great teacher in my opinion. The course in general is pretty tough, especially if you're not an experienced programmer. But in general he's a great teacher and I recommend this course Aric was one of my favorite professors by far. Sometimes the coursework can be quite challenging, however, there are so many office hours that you can always find someone to help. Also, going to class was always reinforcing the lecture videos watched before class. Most weekly assignments consist of watching lecture videos and completing a Jupyter notebook before Monday's class, starting a coding exercise in Monday's class to be done by Wednesday morning, and the occasional 3 times a semester coding assignment due on Friday. Overall, definitely super manageable and would 100% take it with him again. He also is super understanding about needing extension and prioritizes learning above all else. Aric and his class are fantastic. His coursework can be tough, but you get some valuable learning out of everything you do in Python. Although you learn a good chunk of the course content online for homework, The lecture videos he posts every week are nice and easy to follow and make examples out of for homework and projects. His exams are tough but reasonable, and they follow the structure of the practice exams almost to a tee. The cherry on the top is that his office hours are very open-ended and are online, too, so you can drop in whenever they're open (they're open quite frequently and even go pretty late some nights) and get some big help with anything you're having issues with. Overall, coming from comp sci, his course structure is definitely a league above any other programming class I've taken here so far. I love this guy lol. Aric really does care about all his students developing Python skills and provides enough resources for everyone to leave the class able to program proficiently. He provides video lectures and practice to be watched and done from wed-sun so that on Monday you come in ready to use the lecture skills on an in-class exercise. I stress that everyone comes to class on Mondays as he gives practice points simply for being present in class and doing the exercise, if you don't finish the exercise you have until the start of class on Wednesday to submit. If you run into trouble he and his TAs have so many office hours available and they're all mostly online through Discord so you really have no excuse to not go to office hours to get help. I really wouldn't have done so well in his class if it weren't for office hour help sessions.\r\nOther tips for success: \r\n- For lecture vids, have your screen split half vid, half jupyter lab to take notes (highly recommend taking notes in jupyter lab as the graded practices are jupyter notebooks)\r\n- In class don't just sit and watch him go over concepts, take notes during this time. I recommend doing them in jupyter or on an ipad or physical pen and paper as his whiteboard doodles sometimes contain things like tables and little diagrams and generally you remember more by writing. Also his exams are pen and paper so the more you get used to writing code by hand the better you'll do on the exams.\r\n- Do his practice exam several times over and take his practice pages seriously!! His practices are quite similar to his actual exams, he never does things to purposely confuse you he is quite clear on what is going to appear on the exam.\r\n- Do all work ahead of time, especially homeworks!! Office hours are your best friend.\r\n- Try to scout out people you want to work on the final project ahead of time, (would recommend sitting closer to the front of the class and finding people who are always present in class and work hard)\r\n- Do his whiteboard activities, it's kinda embarrassing to go up and participate but the social anxiety-provoking aspect of it helps you remember better I swear. While Bills is a good person, I WISH someone told me not to take him. He has 4 on-paper python exams (no cheat sheet, closed laptop, etc). He is very lenient for late work if you email him before the due date, but he also gives attendance quizzes that close 5 min into class, so you don't get credit if you're more than like 3 minutes late.\r\n\r\nAlso, he and his TAs refuse to grade or put anything into elms. It is May 1st, and we currently have 3 grades put into elms (one which was auto bc it was an elms survey). I have to manually calculate my grade from a month ago based on the few grades they put into gradescope. \r\n\r\nYou'll like his class if you're already comfortable with python and are on time to almost every single class. And also if you can carry your group project. He is a good guy though, just a harsh, slow grader and a bit old-fashioned (on paper coding) not a bad guy or lecturer but he never grades anything ever for so long. i literally don't know my grade and the sem ends this week. also you'll have to take 4 in-person, closed-note, closed-laptop, on-paper coding exams, do with that info what u will! This guy is a social reject. Genuinely he tries to teach you something but he teaching us some of the most useless things in python that we will never use in the real world. What kind of a professor takes the last attempt on a quiz as the grade and not the best grade. Tbh if you wanna learn useless subjects take him if not take any other professor. I put expecting a B because I am aiming for a B or higher but I'm not sure if that will actually happen. I believe the glaze for this professor is kind of crazy. I really wish someone could have told me NOT to take this guy. He is very reasonable, he will give you an extension on almost everything and you dont need a reason for it. You also set how long you want the extension which is pretty neat. Now I never had to worry about turning things in late so this wasnt really much of a plus for me. He does random attendance quiz on any given day and if you were to come 5 minutes late, you're out of luck. I and many people have talked to him about it and he is pretty firm about it. Another thing, people won't admit it but so many people have private tutors, were previously comp sci majors, or have had previous experience in python that gave them an edge in this class, or they are simply retaking this class. So it looks like everyone is understanding the general memo but people really arent!! You are not alone. INST126 was a joke, that class did not prepare me for 326 at all and no amount of studying and lecture watching and asking of questions helped me either. For reference, I do sit in the front of the class and go to office hours regularly. But this class is actually very hard but it doesn't feel hard at the same time. He provides examples for how to do certain code but then we get our assignment and its as if we are in a masters class. His code does not prepare you at all for his assignments, it really makes no sense!!!! Even he himself knows everyone uses chatgpt. Like there is literally no way the information you have provided us so far is able to complete these assignments. Not too mention, one time I had a question on an assignment and I asked the TA for more help. Not even the TA knew the answer. So if I dont know, and you don't know, who's gonna know?? But yeah, all in all, I wish I took this class online. My friend is also taking this class online and they can admit that it is much easier than it being done in person. They do not have 4 midterms plus a final presentation. It really is just an added stress when you realize other people in 326 classes are not going through the same pain as you. For now, on I will be closely looking at the reviews for professors with high ratings because this is ridiculous. TLDR; If you just want an A do not take this professor, if you are aiming for retention(which isn't that beneficial in my opinion as you can learn in many ways outside of school), then take this professor. His lectures are done through videos on elms and then he expects you to have questions on the video and asking during class. If you like this type of learning style then this class may be up your ally. But I personally hated it because there was never really a right time to ask questions in class because he kind of expects you to know the material since you have watched the videos. The amount of awkward silence whenever he asked questions based on his online lectures is funny. This class isn't asynchronous btw. Office hours were also really weird as they were done through text on discord as most TA's didn't want to zoom. There is also no curve in this class plus 4 midterms and a final presentation. Fun coding course where I learned some pretty interesting concepts compared to other theory heavy coding classes. Be good student, don't be lazy, show up on time, and study and you are guaranteed at least a B. I don\u2019t recommend taking this class. The professor does want you to learn and is nice in his own way, but the class is insanely overwhelming. He gives so many things to do every week, with most assignments due at 9 am, so you have no choice but to do them the day before.\r\n\r\nHere is how a typical week goes: You start with a Jupyter notebook practice due by Monday morning, which requires watching a TON of recorded lecture videos. Then, there\u2019s an in-class group coding exercise due Wednesday morning, meaning you\u2019ll probably spend Tuesday working on it. You might have a homework assignment due on Friday, but if you\u2019re lucky, there may be nothing. Additionally, there are 4 exams throughout the semester and they are always on Wednesdays every 2-3 weeks.\r\n\r\nOn exam weeks, you still have to complete the plethora of weekly assignments. While he sometimes eases up by making the exercises easier during these weeks, there\u2019s still a lot to do. The excessive amount of group work required, often needing to be done outside of class, makes it hard to coordinate with everyone and takes up all your personal time. The final project is also a group project, and while it may seem easy it can be incredibly unorganized at times.\r\n\r\nI am never at peace since the to-do list is never done. While I didn\u2019t expect to breeze through this class, this is a little too much to bear. The professor is passionate about the topic, but in my opinion, it\u2019s just not worth the stress. I really like this professor as a person\u2014super nice and understanding\u2014but as a teacher? I wouldn\u2019t recommend this course.\r\n\r\nThe class structure is a mess (at least in my opinion). There are three lectures a week, but instead of actual teaching, they\u2019re just Q&A sessions based on 1-2 hours of assigned videos you have to watch beforehand. If you thrive in an \"ask-and-answer\" learning environment, this might work for you. But if you don\u2019t want three mandatory discussions every week, it\u2019s a nightmare. Essentially, the class is entirely self-taught.\r\n\r\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on the pop quizzes\u2014if you\u2019re even two minutes late, you\u2019re out of luck. So, not only do these so-called \u201clectures\u201d require you to come fully prepared, but you\u2019re also forced to attend because of these surprise quizzes.\r\n\r\nThere are four exams spaced every 2-3 weeks, plus assignments that seem to be due at the most inconvenient times (not even 11:59 PM deadlines). It felt like there was always something hanging over my head. As someone who\u2019s not the best at coding, I had to cram like crazy for the exams\u2014and somehow survived.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for a structured, engaging learning experience, this isn\u2019t it. Honestly I don't get why so many people praises this guy. His teaching style isnt for everybody. His deadlines are so odd like who puts deadline for 11pm and 9am? also 4 exams on paper thats written and its 35% of your grade. I wish i hadn't taken it with him. if you're good at python you should take his class"
