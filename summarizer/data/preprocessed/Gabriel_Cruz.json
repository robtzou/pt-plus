When you ask a question, you say, \"Uh\u2026\u2026\" for half an hour. \r\n\r\nIf you're really confident in Python, go for it! Excellent professor. He goes over all the content; if you ask questions, he will answer. People are just salty because they haven't programmed or aren't trying to in the future, so they are shocked that they had to be engaged just a bit to get an A. He's ok. No exams so that's a nice thing. You have weekly exercises during discussion and there's 4 big homework assignments. He says he will help, but he's usually busy, so you got to rely on the TAs. Lectures are not mandatory but they're also not helpful, so you have to teach yourself a good portion of the content. not accommodating Tries to act like he's professional, yet consistently posts sloppy autograders late. Had to email him for half of the homework autograders because they were either incorrect (i.e. my code was correct but was failing the autograder for whatever reason) and/or posted days, even weeks after the assignment was posted on Canvas. Had to wait almost a week for a response from him so ended up going through the TA anyway. I find it ironic that a professor who is so strict about people not turning in things late constantly posts things and responds to emails late himself. As for the content, I'm fine with self-teaching so I didn't go to any lectures, so I can't speak about the quality of those. Not the worst professor in the world, but would recommend avoiding if possible. I have noticed people who do poorly in the course are the same people who use AI on all their homework and have gone through the entire INST degree program with just \"getting by.\" Tons of material that is properly covered, is there when you need him, stays after class, or asks you to walk with him if you have questions and answers questions in a timely manner, he has a full-time software engineering job on top of teaching but I never felt once like that got in the way. This dude is incompetent, his lectures aren't worth attending and all his homework end up with bugged auto graders. He is slow to respond to emails or slack(1+ weeks) and when he does respond they are full of typos and punctuation errors, sometimes completely unreadable. Most of his online homework assignments you will never get a full score unless you reach out to him or a TA personally because they never work. Overall this class is a hassle and would never recommend you take with this professor, a joke of a class. Just took his first quiz for 326. This professor does not care about this class at all. His quizzes were riddled with errors and TAs were explicitly told to not help us even regarding test errors. do not take this professor. The worst professor you can take for 326, he takes forever to respond back to emails, and is very incompetent. This class is intense and just an absolute joke. Plus, his autograders half of the time is incorrect which gets very annoying and his lectures are very useless and pointless, anyways the point of this is if you aren't good at coding in python and actually want to learn it don't take this wack professor. I regret taking him and wished I had dropped this class from him and switched to a better professor when I had the chance. Gabriel is a graduate of this program, so expect of him what you expect of your fellow students. The autograders are always broken so you do not even know if you got part of the assignment correct. Along with this, if you email him about it he most likely will not respond. I've had multiple occasions where both he and his TAs do not respond to emails. The lectures are worthless along with the slides so expect to learn everything on your own. Take another teacher for your own sanity.",
