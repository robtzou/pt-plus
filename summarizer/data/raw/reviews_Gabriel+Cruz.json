If we understand and understand that, we'll be sitting at MIT. \r\n\r\nTA also doesn't know what the task is about.

He says he will help, but he's usually busy, so you got to rely on the TAs. Lectures are not mandatory but they're also not helpful, so you have to teach yourself a good portion of the content.",

Had to email him for half of the homework autograders because they were either incorrect (i.e. my code was correct but was failing the autograder for whatever reason) and/or posted days, even weeks after the assignment was posted on Canvas. Had to wait almost a week for a response from him so ended up going through the TA anyway. I find it ironic that a professor who is so strict about people not turning in things late constantly posts things and responds to emails late himself. As for the content, I'm fine with self-teaching so I didn't go to any lectures, so I can't speak about the quality of those. Not the worst professor in the world, but would recommend avoiding if possible.",

He is slow to respond to emails or slack(1+ weeks) and when he does respond they are full of typos and punctuation errors, sometimes completely unreadable. Most of his online homework assignments you will never get a full score unless you reach out to him or a TA personally because they never work. Overall this class is a hassle and would never recommend you take with this professor, a joke of a class.",

Plus, his autograders half of the time is incorrect which gets very annoying and his lectures are very useless and pointless, anyways the point of this is if you aren't good at coding in python and actually want to learn it don't take this wack professor. I regret taking him and wished I had dropped this class from him and switched to a better professor when I had the chance.",
