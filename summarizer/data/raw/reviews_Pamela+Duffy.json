Frankly, they have no idea how students actually learn, and they assign a stupid amount of pointless work which teaches you absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\nLong ass discussion boards every two weeks, required presentations which are nothing but busy work, and you're required to attend discussions every week, where literally all you do is wait until the TA gives you answers for work that you could just do yourself at home. Discussions in this class were the worst thing I've ever done in school or at UMD in general. Worst class I've ever taken. ",

Most assignments are easy, even if you meet any problem you can quickly solve it during office hours. The only hard part of this course is that sometimes you have to deal with shitty teammates.",

The class consists of in-person lectures, weekly class assignments that are done together in a class, three major take-home assignments, and three larger project assignments that follow a similar style to the homework assignments. The issue with this course is that there isn't really a clear direction in which it wants to go. The lecture slides aren't very helpful, and nearly all of the readings are random and don't correlate with what's being covered in class. Easily, the worst part of the course was the agpss part of the course. There needs to be more content that students can reference, such as recorded lectures and lecture videos, considering the class only meets once a week. Overall, the course wasn't too bad, but it felt rushed and unfinished at times. Dr. Diker would normally go on for over an hour, and Duffy would speed-run the remaining slides after Dr. Diker would leave. The class overall is not bad, just rough when one group assignment has the potential to tank your grade.",

Personally I found this course to be quite hard and apparently this is an unpopular opinion but I thought 326 was better than 327. The lecture vids were really hard for me to watch, I would often get bored and couldn't follow along with what was happening. The lecture vids and understanding the material are the hardest part of the course but the in-person labs and discussion board posts are basically easy grade boosters to help balance out the difficulty.",

This class focuses heavily on SQL and isn\u2019t too difficult if you stay on top of things. To succeed, make sure to watch the lecture videos, complete the quizzes before class, and follow along with the in-class code examples and skeleton files provided. Don\u2019t hesitate to ask for help in ELMS or Piazza. Both the TA's and professors are very supportive. Additionally, shoutout to TA Angela! She is amazing and very knowledgeable, and explains concepts clearly. Each discussion is mandatory, and we start with 15 minutes to try the lab exercises on our own. After that, the TA walks through them step by step, which is super helpful. Additionally, there is a semester-long database design project. Make sure to pick a good group within your class section early on, or you\u2019ll be placed randomly. Some parts of the project require meeting up and working on the same device, so it\u2019s important to have a cooperative group. The project can get challenging if group members don\u2019t pull their weight.",

Her lectures are not interesting and simply mimic what is spoken in the video quizzes. I preferred Professor Diker over her, but unfortunately, she teaches most of the course. She put more effort into reporting half the class for being in a GroupMe than to ensuring her lessons are engaging. If you are able to, do not take Professor Duffy for this class. She's not worth the mental and academic stress.",

She creates a GroupMe for the class, then accuses half the class for cheating because we asked questions in it? I stopped going to lecture but she tries to make jokes mid lecture and all of them are bricks. Although she knows the material and can somewhat teach, she's just miserable to have, just find a better professor (not hard). She needs to wrap it up at this point",

However, that being said, it felt like she was really unresponsive to elms messages (her preferred communication) and had poor communication with not only her students but her TAs as well. I was thankful to have a wonderful discussion TA to help me during this class. As someone said too, there was a big academic dishonesty case in the class, and I was a part of it simply for being in the group chat. I do not blame her for what had happened, but I do feel a little bitter over the fact I begged for help and had such bad communication to resolve the matter. Other than that, I did enjoy the textbook and think it is an easy read for the class. PLEASE pick people who have good work ethics for the group project, I am very thankful I had such kind and hardworking teammates, it makes the class way more enjoyable.",
