  "all_merged_reviews": "The professor has a very relaxed attitude towards teaching, but students found that while there is plenty of material covered, it's often difficult to get help from him directly due to his busy schedule or unresponsiveness. The course structure includes weekly discussions and exercises, as well as four big homework assignments, without exams. TAs may not know the task either, leaving students on their own to figure things out.\n\nThe professor's personality is:\n\n- Relaxed attitude towards teaching: the professor doesn't attend lectures, doesn't provide direct help when asked, and seems unresponsive to emails or other forms of communication (despite claiming to be professional).\n\n- Claims he will help but is busy: despite professing that they can ask for help at any time, students often found themselves having difficulty getting responses from the professor due to his schedule.\n\n- Autograder issues: autograders often fail to give correct scores or are delayed in posting results, which requires students to rely on other means of verification (like TAs).\n\n- TAs lack knowledge: TA's do not know what the task is about and cannot provide proper guidance.\n\nCourse Structure:\n\n- Weekly discussions/exercises without mandatory attendance.\n- Four big homework assignments with no exams.\n- Students have to teach themselves a portion of content due to lack of lecturer support.\n- Lectures are not helpful, so students end up relying on their own efforts or TA's help.\n\nCritiques and warnings:\n- Be prepared for a difficult time getting responses from the professor if you need help directly.\n- Autograder reliability can be an issue, potentially affecting your grades.\n- Lack of support from TAs in understanding the tasks or providing guidance may lead to difficulties with assignments.\n- Expect to put in extra effort to learn material and complete exercises due to limited lecturer support. \n\nPlease note that some comments contain strong language, but I tried my best to focus on the key points that were provided in the feedback. This course has been reported by multiple students to have a difficult learning experience if you rely heavily on direct professorial guidance or have trouble with autograder issues, which may impact your grades. It is recommended to be prepared for an independent effort and potentially seeking help through TAs as well if needed. \n\nIt is worth noting that the course has its strengths (excellent content coverage) despite the challenges of working with this particular professor. However, considering the difficulties that many students faced in getting support or dealing with autograder issues, it may not be the most suitable choice for beginners or those seeking a more supportive learning environment.  It is advisable to look for other courses or professors if you value direct guidance and support during your studies. \n\nIn summary, while this course provides excellent content coverage of Python programming, its challenging learning environment and lack of support from the professor may deter some students from taking it or pursuing further in the field. Be cautious when considering enrolling in a course with Professor X, as some students found it frustrating to deal with communication difficulties and technical issues that affected their progress. \n\nIf you decide to take this course, make sure to engage with TAs when possible, be proactive about seeking help when needed, and prioritize your own learning efforts to overcome potential challenges in working with the professor. \n\nPlease keep in mind that some students found that having a good grasp of Python programming already helped them navigate the course more effectively, which is an important factor in overcoming potential difficulties. If you're confident in your coding skills or can adapt well to independent learning, this course might still be worth exploring despite its limitations and challenges. \n\nRemember, it's essential to weigh your needs as a student and choose courses that best suit your learning style and goals. Be cautious of any professor who seems unresponsive or disconnected from their students' progress, and prioritize seeking support through available means (like TAs) if you encounter difficulties in the course.",

      "merged_reviews": "If you are as good as a professor at Python, take this course. \r\n\r\nThe professor never tells us anything related. You'll have to find everything on the Internet. It will also inform you of the assignment through a link to the MIT professor's lecture. If we understand and understand that, we'll be sitting at MIT. \r\n\r\nTA also doesn't know what the task is about. When you ask a question, you say, \"Uh……\" for half an hour. \r\n\r\nIf you're really confident in Python, go for it! Excellent professor. He goes over all the content; if you ask questions, he will answer. People are just salty because they haven't programmed or aren't trying to in the future, so they are shocked that they had to be engaged just a bit to get an A. He's ok. No exams so that's a nice thing. You have weekly exercises during discussion and there's 4 big homework assignments. He says he will help, but he's usually busy, so you got to rely on the TAs. Lectures are not mandatory but they're also not helpful, so you have to teach yourself a good portion of the content. not accommodating Tries to act like he's professional, yet consistently posts sloppy autograders late. Had to email him for half of the homework autograders because they were either incorrect (i.e. my code was correct but was failing the autograder for whatever reason) and/or posted days, even weeks after the assignment was posted on Canvas. Had to wait almost a week for a response from him so ended up going through the TA anyway. I find it ironic that a professor who is so strict about people not turning in things late constantly posts things and responds to emails late himself. As for the content, I'm fine with self-teaching so I didn't go to any lectures, so I can't speak about the quality of those. Not the worst professor in the world, but would recommend avoiding if possible. I have noticed people who do poorly in the course are the same people who use AI on all their homework and have gone through the entire INST degree program with just \"getting by.\" Tons of material that is properly covered, is there when you need him, stays after class, or asks you to walk with him if you have questions and answers questions in a timely manner, he has a full-time software engineering job on top of teaching but I never felt once like that got in the way. This dude is incompetent, his lectures aren't worth attending and all his homework end up with bugged auto graders. He is slow to respond to emails or slack(1+ weeks) and when he does respond they are full of typos and punctuation errors, sometimes completely unreadable. Most of his online homework assignments you will never get a full score unless you reach out to him or a TA personally because they never work. Overall this class is a hassle and would never recommend you take with this professor, a joke of a class. Just took his first quiz for 326. This professor does not care about this class at all. His quizzes were riddled with errors and TAs were explicitly told to not help us even regarding test errors. do not take this professor. The worst professor you can take for 326, he takes forever to respond back to emails, and is very incompetent. This class is intense and just an absolute joke. Plus, his autograders half of the time is incorrect which gets very annoying and his lectures are very useless and pointless, anyways the point of this is if you aren't good at coding in python and actually want to learn it don't take this wack professor. I regret taking him and wished I had dropped this class from him and switched to a better professor when I had the chance. Gabriel is a graduate of this program, so expect of him what you expect of your fellow students. The autograders are always broken so you do not even know if you got part of the assignment correct. Along with this, if you email him about it he most likely will not respond. I've had multiple occasions where both he and his TAs do not respond to emails. The lectures are worthless along with the slides so expect to learn everything on your own. Take another teacher for your own sanity."
